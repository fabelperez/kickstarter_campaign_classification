2. Categorical model to predict if a campaign will be successful or fail.
3. Linear model to see how much money a campaign will earn based on different categories.
4. Predict how much time it will take for a campaign to meet its goal.
5. Classification problem on the data (understand what types of campaigns are the most profitable,
  etc., for kickstarter.)
