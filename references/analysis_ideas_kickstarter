## KICKSTARTER DATASET ANALYSIS IDEAS ##
########################################

1. Time series analysis to see how campaigns have changed over time (from 2009 to 2019).
2. Categorical model to predict if a campaign will be successful or fail.
3. Linear model to see how much money a campaign will earn based on different categories.
4. Predict how much time it will take for a campaign to meet its goal.
5. Classification problem on the data (understand what types of campaigns are the most profitable,
  etc., for kickstarter.)

______________
FEATURE IDEAS:
--------------
* Length of campaign
* campaign relaunch under different names (bool)
* dummy variable for collapsed category (categories found
  here https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)
* perform clustering analysis on our data and then add in the clusters as a new
  variable in our model (pg. 323 in the machine learning textbook)
* the USD_type column could be turned into a feature that is a dummy veriable that says
  is_international
* we are going to have to group our sub_catagory/ catagory variable into smaller
  groups if we want to do one-hot encoding. The smallest group has 150
  variables.
* Blurb length word count.
* the delta between created at and launched at.
* US vs international 


______
NOTES:
------
* two different models with two different end users:
  1. kickstarter trying to figure out what to spotlight
  2. small business owner (creator) who wants to know if their campaigns
     will be successful. This needs to be more explainable (maybe logistic regression)
     so that we can explain what they need to improve in order for their campaign
     to be successful.
* after we create features we should look into feature selection. Creating
  too many new features could overfit our model, and feature selection would
  pick the top n features and build our model with that. (wrapper, forward selection/
  backwards elimination)
* black panther color pallette
* look into running a naive bayes classification (from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB)
* create heat map of project origin locations. Cool to have it interactive, so that when you click on a city/
  state, it will show you a list of project names or categories.
* how many ids have multiple names associated with them?
* look at the correlation between spotlight and success
* look at the correlation between staff pick and success

MOD 5 PROJECT NOTES:
--------------------
* Very few rules in here, but want to talk about selecting a dataset.
* min of 1000 rows and min 10 predictor columns.

Be able to talk about
* add professional doc strings for this (need to find resources for this.)
* chart of all models did and reduction of mean squared error and the selected
  model. Showing that we tried the model would be helpful.

COACH CHECK-IN TO-DO LIST
------------------------
* Explore DATASET
  - understand if data is normally distributed so that we can scale our dataset
    appropriately.
  - central tendency/ distribution/ shape of dataset.
* Come up with menu of features to show the coach
* come up with reasons that we are considering different models
