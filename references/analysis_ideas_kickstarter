## KICKSTARTER DATASET ANALYSIS IDEAS ##
########################################

1. Time series analysis to see how campaigns have changed over time (from 2009 to 2019).
2. Categorical model to predict if a campaign will be successful or fail.
3. Linear model to see how much money a campaign will earn based on different categories.
4. Predict how much time it will take for a campaign to meet its goal.
5. Classification problem on the data (understand what types of campaigns are the most profitable,
  etc., for kickstarter.)

______________
FEATURE IDEAS:
--------------
* Length of campaign
* campaign relaunch under different names (bool)
* dummy variable for collapsed category (categories found
  here https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)
* perform clustering analysis on our data and then add in the clusters as a new
  variable in our model (pg. 323 in the machine learning textbook)
* the USD_type column could be turned into a feature that is a dummy veriable that says
  is_international
* we are going to have to group our sub_catagory/ catagory variable into smaller
  groups if we want to do one-hot encoding. The smallest group has 150
  variables. 

______
NOTES:
------
* after we create features we should look into feature selection. Creating
  too many new features could overfit our model, and feature selection would
  pick the top n features and build our model with that. (wrapper, forward selection/
  backwards elimination)
* black panther color pallette
* look into running a naive bayes classification (from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB)
* create heat map of project origin locations. Cool to have it interactive, so that when you click on a city/
  state, it will show you a list of project names or categories.

MOD 5 PROJECT NOTES:
--------------------
* Very few rules in here, but want to talk about selecting a dataset.
* min of 1000 rows and min 10 predictor columns.

Be ale to talk about
* add professional doc strings for this (need to find resources for this.)
* chart of all models did and reduction of mean squared error and the selected
  model. Showing that we tried the model would be helpful.

COACH CHECK-IN TODO LIST
------------------------
* Explore DATASET
  - understand and label variables with data types
  - understand if data is normally distributed so that we can understand how to
    scale our data.
  - central tendency/ distribution/ shape of dataset.
* Come up with menu of features to show the coach
* come up with reasons that we are considering different models
