## KICKSTARTER DATASET ANALYSIS IDEAS ##
########################################

1. Time series analysis to see how campaigns have changed over time (from 2009 to 2019).
2. Categorical model to predict if a campaign will be successful or fail.
3. Linear model to see how much money a campaign will earn based on different categories.
4. Predict how much time it will take for a campaign to meet its goal.

NOTES:
------
* Collapse the category variable fewer number of categories (categories found
  here https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) so that we can turn them into dummy
  variables.
